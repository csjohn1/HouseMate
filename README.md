# HouseMate

<br>

## Overview
For this final group project, we created an app called HouseMate that allows users to split expenses. They can add other users and split one-time expenses with one or more users, or they can form groups for more regular expense sharing. Users can view a summary of their owed/owing status as well as recent activity on the home page. On the settlements page, they can settle any amount owed and notify any users with amounts owed to them.
## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies for the rails server using ```bundle install``` inside the server folder.
2. Install dependencies for the react client using ```npm install``` inside the client folder.
3. Run ```rails db:reset``` to create, load and seed database.
4. Run ```rails s``` on the server side.
5. Run ```npm start``` on the client side. App will be live on port localhost:3001.
